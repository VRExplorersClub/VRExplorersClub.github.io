Welcome to the home of the VR Explorer's Club. 

In the fast paced land of Virtual Reality, worlds rise and fall in just a few cycles. Yesterday's cutting edge becomes today's normal and tomorrow's ancient history.

Our goal is to explore Virtual Reality worlds and document them so that all can enjoy them, even after the sun has set on them.
