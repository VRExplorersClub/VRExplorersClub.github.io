## Introduction

Virtual Market (VKET) is around for a short time every season. This season's theme of "Next Journey" seems to be kicking off a new plan of "journies" for VKET that will bring it to various places in their Parareal worlds. 

This year, many of the worlds have a gimmick which will be explained in each world's page. 

## Mission Brief

The VR Explorer's Club's objectives at VKET are as follows: 
1. Visit all of the worlds (quest and PC) of VKET. 
2. Document the secrets found in each world. 
3. Observe how the public interacts in the world. 
4. Have fun exploring with each other!

Side Quests for Explorers are as follows: 
1. Obtain and display all of the passport stamps. 
2. Obtain and attach the free assets that are prizes for finding the VKET secrets. 

## Debriefs


The original theme spiel from VKET (with the Next Journey logo) is located below the world tiles in a spoiler box.

<p>We have been in an era where the internet enables us to connect with each other and access almost anything.  <br>
A mere swipe of a finger allows us to dive into the sea of information on a tiny screen.  </p>
  <br><br>
But now, we are in the era of Metaverse, a spatial web.  <br>
A blink of an eye won't just grant us the passage to information, but a journey through space.  <br><br>
  
"Just went to Europe yesterday."  <br>
"Maybe today I'll try America."
<br><br>
It may seem surreal.  <br>
It may seem like something from a fantasy novel.  <br>
Not anymore. This is exactly what we're starting to hear. 
  <br><br>
Let us jump into this new era.  
<br><br>  
Next Journey, Vket.
